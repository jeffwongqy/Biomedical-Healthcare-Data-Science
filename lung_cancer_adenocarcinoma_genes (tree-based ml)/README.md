## Project Background
Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer worldwide, with adenocarcinoma being its most common subtype. Despite advancements in treatment, the prognosis for lung adenocarcinoma patients often remains poor due to late-stage diagnoses and limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the disease.

Recent breakthroughs in genomic sequencing have provided researchers with vast amounts of data on the genetic alterations associated with lung adenocarcinoma. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these genomic profiles present significant challenges in identifying key genes and pathways involved in the development and progression of the disease.

In this context, predictive modeling techniques offer a promising approach to uncovering the genetic signatures underlying lung adenocarcinoma. By leveraging tree-based approaches, such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, researchers can analyze large-scale genomic datasets to identify biomarkers, molecular pathways, and potential therapeutic targets with greater accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop and validate predictive models for identifying key genes associated with lung adenocarcinoma using tree-based approaches. Specifically, the project aims to:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather comprehensive genomic datasets, including gene expression profiles, somatic mutations, copy number variations, and clinical data, from public repositories and research cohorts. Preprocess the data to remove noise, correct for batch effects, and standardize features for compatibility with tree-based algorithms.

2. Feature Selection and Model Training: Employ various tree-based algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines, to select informative features and build predictive models. Explore different parameter settings and ensemble techniques to optimize model performance and generalization across diverse datasets.

3. Model Evaluation and Interpretation: Assess the predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of the developed models using cross-validation, independent validation cohorts, and performance metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and precision-recall curve. Interpret the models to identify key genes, molecular pathways, and biological insights underlying lung adenocarcinoma progression.

4. Clinical Translation and Validation: Validate the predictive models in clinical settings using patient-derived samples and real-world data. Evaluate the models' utility in predicting patient outcomes, treatment response, and disease prognosis, and assess their potential for guiding personalized therapeutic interventions and clinical decision-making.

## Data Collection
Collected data from BARRA:CuRDa (https://sbcb.inf.ufrgs.br/barracurda) is to utilize a curated RNA-seq database specifically tailored for cancer research, ensuring high-quality and relevant genomic data for analysis and modeling in the context of lung cancer adenocarcinoma.
