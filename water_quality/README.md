# Machine Learning for Safe Drinking Water Assessment 

## Project Background
Access to clean drinking water is a fundamental human right, yet millions globally lack this essential resource. This project explores the potential of machine learning to assess water potability. We propose a machine learning model that can analyze various water quality parameters to predict the presence of contaminants and classify water as safe or unsafe for consumption.

## Project Objectives
1. This project will explore how ML can leverage a vast array of water quality data to classify water sources as safe or unsafe for drinking. 
2. We will compare machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective approach for accurately classifying water potability. 
3. By pinpointing the most critical water quality indicators, we will gain insights to develop target monitoring strategies, maximising efficiency, and effectiveness. 
4. This project bridge the gap between traditional methods and cutting-edge AI, paving teh way for faster, more efficient water safety assessments.

- This data obtained from Kaggle contains 21 different measurements for 8,000 water samples, allowing us to build powerful models to assess water safety. 
- Let's dive into what these measurements mean:
-- Metals: Aluminum, Arsenic, Barium, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Lead, Mercury, Silver, Uranium, Selenium, Radium - These can be harmful at high levels.
-- Chemicals: Ammonia, Chloramine, Fluoride, Nitrates, Nitrites, Perchlorate - These can indicate pollution or treatment processes.
-- Biological: Bacteria, Viruses - These directly impact water safety.
